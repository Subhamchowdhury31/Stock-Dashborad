Stock Prediction Dashboard

--üöÄ Overview

--The Stock Prediction Dashboard is an advanced web application designed to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The application uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast stock prices, leveraging historical stock price data. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer for better prediction accuracy. This dashboard allows users to select stocks, view historical data, and generate predictions based on past performance.

--üõ†Ô∏è Features

-Key Features:
---Historical Stock Data
The dashboard fetches and displays historical stock data, which users can analyze over different time frames.
---Stock Price Prediction
The LSTM model predicts future stock prices based on historical price data, providing users with potential future price trends.


--Data Visualization
Interactive charts that display historical stock prices, allowing users to visualize past trends and understand stock performance over time.
Customizable Stock Selection
Users can choose specific stocks by their symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) to generate predictions.


---User-Friendly Interface
The interface is designed to be intuitive, enabling users to navigate through the features with ease.
üîß Technologies Used

Frontend:
React.js
Chart.js / D3.js (for stock data visualization)
Tailwind CSS (for responsive UI)


---Backend:
Python
Flask or Django (for serving LSTM model predictions via an API)
Machine Learning:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for time series forecasting, perfect for predicting stock prices based on past data.
Adam Optimizer: An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm used for training the LSTM model efficiently.



---APIs:
Alpha Vantage API or Yahoo Finance API for fetching historical stock data.


---Database:
MongoDB or SQL (for storing historical stock data, user preferences, etc.)
